## Description

Keeping track of teams as they expand is often an issue many growing companies find themselves in. With the team generator, someone can set up profiles for an intern, engineer, or manager. The generator creates an HTML file that displays the cards.
Managers accept Name, ID, Email, and office number
Interns accept Name, ID, Email, and School
and Engineers accept Name, ID, Email and github username
